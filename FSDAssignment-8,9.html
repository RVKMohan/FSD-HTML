            <hr>
            <p>Full stack development refers to the end-to-end application software development, including the front end
                and back end.</p>
            <p></p> The front end consists of the user interface, and the back end takes care of the business logic and
            application workflows.</p>

            <p>The main components of a full stack development are the front-end, back-end and database</p>
        </fieldset>
    </center>
    <fieldset>
        <p>Consider a retail website. Users can browse or purchase specific items, delete or add items in cart, change
            their profile, and do many other things. All these actions require a front-end user interface (UI), as well
            as some business logic, written in the back-end.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                The website UI can be built using various, <u>front-end technologies</u> like HTML, CSS, Javascript.
            </li>
            <li>
                The back end is written in programming languages like Java or Python. Further, a good web application
                would need scalability, event handling, and routing, which are usually handled by libraries and
                frameworks like SpringBoot or Django.
            </li>
            <li>
                The back end also consists of logic that can connect the application to other services and databases.
                For example, all the user and transaction data is stored in a database through specific drivers handled
                on the back end.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset>
        <legend><b>Front end vs back end vs full stack</b></legend>
        <p>Applications that require higher scalability and more complex workflows require broader skill sets and
            collaboration across teams. For example, the front end may be handled by the UI team, and the back end by
            another team. In some organizations, individuals will be required to work on both the front-end and back-end
            implementation of a feature. This is where full stack developers would come into play.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <b> Front-end developer</b>
            </li>
            <p>These developers handle the UI of a web application (or website)—for example, visual effects, frames,
                navigation, and forms. They focus mainly on user experience and use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as
                programming languages.</p>
            <li>
                <b> Back-end developers</b>
            </li>
            <p>
                They deal with the business logic, security, performance, scalability, and handling request-response of
                the application. They create or use frameworks to design the core application workflows and use
                technologies like JavaScript, Python, Java, and .NET.
            </p>
            <li>
                <b>Full stack developers</b>
            </li>
            <p>
                They are responsible for coding end-to-end workflows by using both front-end and back-end technologies.
                MERN stack and MEAN stack are examples of JavaScript-based technology stacks that full stack developers
                can use to build end-to-end applications.

            There are many advantages of hiring full stack developers for web application development:
            <ul type="square">
                <li>
                    Complete ownership and understanding of the project

                <li>
                    Saves both project time and cost, and enhances productivity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Faster bug fixing due to knowledge of complete system
                </li>
                <li>
                    Easy knowledge transfer to other team members
                </li>
                <li>
                    Better division of work amongst team members

            <b>Conclusion</b>
        </legend>
        <p>
            Full stack development provides a faster and more efficient development experience to build web
            applications, as team members are equipped with the knowledge of various technologies and tools and can use
            their diverse knowledge for development as well as future research. The two most popular technology
            stacks—i.e., MEAN stack and MERN stack—use MongoDB as their core database, which has a flexible schema and
            provides scalability and high availability for any project size.
