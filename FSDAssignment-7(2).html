        <b>What is Front-End Development?</b>
        <p>
            The front-end is built using a combination of technologies such as Hypertext Markup Language (HTML),
            JavaScript and Cascading Style Sheets (CSS).

            Front-end developers design and construct the user experience elements on the web page or app including
            buttons, menus, pages, links, graphics and more.

                        Hypertext Markup Language is the core of a website, providing the overall design and
                        functionality.

                <li>
                    <p>The updated version includes more tools aimed at web application developers as well as
                        adjustments made to improve interoperability.</p>

                Cascading style sheets give developers a flexible, precise way to create attractive, interactive website
                designs.

                    JavaScript
                </b>
                <p>This event-based language is useful for creating dynamic elements on static HTML web pages.It allows
                    developers to access elements separate from the main HTML page, as well as respond to server-side
                    events.</p>
                <p>Front-end frameworks such as Angular, Ember, Backbone, and React are also popular.These frameworks
                    let developers keep up with the growing demand for enterprise software without sacrificing quality,
                    so they’re earning their place as standard development tools.One of the main challenges of front-end
                    development - which also goes by the name “client-side development” - <u>is the rapid pace of change
                        in the tools, techniques and technologies used to create the user experience for applications
                        and websites</u>.The seemingly simple goal of creating a clear, easy-to-follow user interface is
                    difficult due to sometimes widely different mobile device and computer screen resolutions and
                    sizes.Things get even more complicated when the Internet of Things (IoT) is considered.Screen size
                    and network connection now have a wider variety, so developers have to balance those concerns when
                    working on their user interfaces.

                    The back-end, also called the server-side, consists of the server which provides data on request,
                    the application that channels it, and the database which organizes the information.

                    For example, when a customer browses shoes on a website, they are interacting with the front end.

                    After they select the item they want, put it in the shopping cart, and authorize the purchase, the
                    information is kept inside the database which resides on the server.
